# SHIPSY Campus Assessment - Shipment Management System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive web application built for the SHIPSY campus assessment. It demonstrates a complete shipment management system with authentication, CRUD operations, filtering, pagination, and modern UI/UX design.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication
- **Login Page**: Simple username/password authentication
- **Demo Credentials**: 
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `shipsy123`
- **Session Management**: Persistent login state using localStorage
- **Logout Functionality**: Clean session termination

### 2. CRUD Operations (Shipment Management)
- **Create**: Add new shipments with comprehensive form validation
- **Read**: View all shipments in a structured table format
- **Update**: Edit existing shipment details
- **Delete**: Remove shipments with confirmation dialog

### 3. Form Fields (As Required)
- **Text Inputs**: Origin, Destination, Weight, Tracking Number
- **Dropdown (Enum)**: Status (Pending, In Transit, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Cancelled)
- **Dropdown (Enum)**: Priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- **Boolean Checkbox**: Fragile item handling
- **Date Input**: Estimated delivery date
- **Number Input**: Weight with decimal support

### 4. View Page Features
- **List View**: Clean table layout with all shipment details
- **Filtering**: 
  - By Status (dropdown)
  - By Priority (dropdown)
  - By Search (tracking number, origin, destination)
- **Pagination**: 10 items per page with navigation controls
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### 5. Additional Features
- **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering as you type
- **Status Icons**: Visual indicators for different shipment statuses
- **Priority Badges**: Color-coded priority levels
- **Fragile Item Indicators**: Special handling alerts
- **Auto-generated Tracking Numbers**: Unique identifiers for each shipment
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded demo shipments for testing

## Technical Architecture

### Schema Design
```typescript
interface Shipment {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  trackingNumber: string;        // Auto-generated tracking number
  origin: string;                // Shipment origin location
  destination: string;           // Shipment destination
  status: ShipmentStatus;        // Current shipment status (enum)
  priority: ShipmentPriority;    // Shipment priority level (enum)
  isFragile: boolean;            // Fragile handling requirement
  weight: number;                // Package weight in kg
  estimatedDelivery: string;     // Expected delivery date
  createdAt: string;             // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: string;             // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Class Structure
- **AuthService**: Handles login/logout and session management
- **ShipmentService**: Manages all CRUD operations and business logic
- **StorageService**: Abstracts localStorage operations with error handling
- **React Components**: Functional components with hooks for state management

## AI Prompts Used

### 1. Initial Project Setup
**Prompt**: "Create a comprehensive shipment management system for SHIPSY with login, CRUD operations, filtering, and pagination"
**Reasoning**: Needed to establish the overall architecture and requirements

### 2. Schema Design
**Prompt**: "Design a TypeScript interface for shipments with enums for status and priority, including all required field types"
**Reasoning**: Required proper type safety and data structure definition

### 3. Service Layer Architecture
**Prompt**: "Create service classes for authentication and shipment management with proper error handling and localStorage integration"
**Reasoning**: Needed separation of concerns and robust data management

### 4. UI/UX Enhancement
**Prompt**: "Design a modern, professional interface with SHIPSY branding, proper spacing, and responsive design"
**Reasoning**: Required production-quality user interface matching company standards

### 5. Form Validation
**Prompt**: "Implement comprehensive form validation with error handling for all input types including edge cases"
**Reasoning**: Needed robust input validation and user feedback

## Test Plan

### Positive Test Cases
1. **Login Success**: Valid credentials should authenticate user
2. **Create Shipment**: All required fields filled should create new shipment
3. **Update Shipment**: Editing existing shipment should save changes
4. **Delete Shipment**: Confirmation should remove shipment from list
5. **Filter by Status**: Selecting status should show only matching shipments
6. **Search Functionality**: Typing in search should filter results
7. **Pagination**: Navigation should work correctly across pages

### Negative Test Cases
1. **Invalid Login**: Wrong credentials should show error message
2. **Empty Required Fields**: Form should prevent submission and show validation
3. **Invalid Weight**: Non-numeric or negative weight should show error
4. **Future Date Validation**: Past delivery dates should be handled appropriately
5. **Delete Non-existent**: Attempting to delete removed item should handle gracefully

### Edge Test Cases
1. **Empty State**: No shipments should show appropriate message
2. **Single Item**: Pagination should handle single page correctly
3. **Maximum Weight**: Very large weight values should be handled
4. **Long Text Fields**: Extended origin/destination names should display properly
5. **Rapid Filtering**: Quick filter changes should not cause UI issues
6. **Browser Refresh**: Page reload should maintain authentication state
7. **LocalStorage Full**: Storage quota exceeded should be handled gracefully

## Deployment
- **Platform**: Deployed on Vercel
- **Build Process**: Vite production build
- **Environment**: Modern browsers with ES2020+ support

## Future Improvements
Given more time, I would enhance the application with:

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace localStorage with proper API endpoints
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live shipment tracking
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard with charts and metrics
4. **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export capabilities
5. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select for batch updates/deletes
6. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, weight ranges, custom filters
7. **Audit Trail**: Track all changes with timestamps and user info
8. **Mobile App**: React Native version for mobile access
9. **Email Notifications**: Automated status update notifications
10. **Integration APIs**: Connect with shipping carriers for real tracking

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (demo purposes)

This application demonstrates modern web development practices, clean architecture, and attention to user experience while fulfilling all assessment requirements.
